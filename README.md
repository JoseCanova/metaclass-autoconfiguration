# metaclass-autoconfiguration
Experiment to load the classconstruction of the metamodel in autoconfiguration mode

##### 20-03-2025 Already tested, a efficient manner to build components to manage component configurations, but it does not apply for the archtectual problem that i`ve in mind, the solution candidate continues a "pre" SpringApplication.run component, which means a out of context solution, i was trying to avoid to facilitate the management of the implementation but it will not be possible, SpringApplication limits where a ClassLoader must be populated with the classes generated by bytebuddy that will enter on Repository Scanning process, moreover with SpringDataRest autoconfiguration enabled which moves the repository scanning to the top of application initialization.
